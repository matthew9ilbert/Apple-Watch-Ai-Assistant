## Architectural Pattern

WatchAssistant follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern:

- **Models**: Data structures and business logic
- **Views**: User interface components
- **ViewModels**: Represented by the Manager classes that handle business logic and state

## Key Components

### 1. Voice Assistant System

The voice assistant functionality is primarily handled by:
- `AssistantManager`: Processes voice inputs and generates responses
- `AssistantView`: Provides the user interface for interactions
- `ChatModels`: Stores conversation history and interaction patterns

### 2. Health Monitoring System

Health tracking features are managed by:
- `HealthManager`: Interfaces with HealthKit and processes health data
- `FitnessView`: Displays health metrics and workout controls
- `UserProfile.HealthPreferences`: Stores user's health-related settings

### 3. Smart Home Control

Home automation is handled by:
- `HomeAutomationManager`: Interfaces with HomeKit
- `HomeControlView`: Provides UI for controlling smart devices
- `UserProfile.HomePreferences`: Stores user's home automation preferences

### 4. Settings and Configuration

User settings are managed by:
- `SettingsView`: Interface for changing app preferences
- `UserProfileManager`: Persists user settings
- Various preference models in `UserProfile`

## Data Flow

1. **Voice Commands**:
   - User speaks to watch via `AssistantView`
   - `AssistantManager` processes speech via Speech framework
   - Commands are analyzed and routed to appropriate manager
   - Response is generated and presented back to user

2. **Health Data**:
   - `HealthManager` requests authorization to access HealthKit
   - Watch sensors collect data (heart rate, steps, etc.)
   - Data is processed and stored via HealthKit
   - Metrics and insights are presented in `FitnessView`

3. **Home Control**:
   - `HomeAutomationManager` connects to HomeKit
   - Device state changes from user input in `HomeControlView`
   - Commands are sent to devices via HomeKit
   - Device state updates are reflected in UI

4. **Settings**:
   - User modifies preferences in `SettingsView`
   - Changes are persisted via `UserProfileManager`
   - Updated settings affect app behavior

## Dependencies

- **SwiftUI**: For all user interface components
- **HealthKit**: For health and fitness data
- **HomeKit**: For smart home device control
- **CoreML**: For on-device machine learning
- **Speech**: For voice recognition
- **NaturalLanguage**: For text processing and analysis

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Keep files under 400 lines where possible
   - Group related functionality in extensions
   - Use clear naming conventions

2. **Performance**:
   - Minimize background processing
   - Use efficient data structures
   - Implement caching where appropriate

3. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all managers
   - Create UI tests for critical user flows
   - Test voice recognition with diverse samples

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Support VoiceOver
   - Provide alternative input methods
   - Use appropriate contrast ratios

## Future Considerations

As outlined in the Roadmap, we'll need to:
1. Extend the AI capabilities of `AssistantManager`
2. Add more sophisticated health analysis to `HealthManager`
3. Expand device support in `HomeAutomationManager`
4. Consider creating specialized managers for new features
