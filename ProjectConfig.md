- watchOS 9.0 or later
- iOS 16.0 or later (for companion app)

### Device Requirements
- Apple Watch Series 4 or later (recommended Series 6 or later for optimal performance)
- watchOS 9.0 or later
- iPhone running iOS 16.0 or later (for initial setup and companion features)

## Required Frameworks and APIs

The app integrates with the following Apple frameworks:

### Core Functionality
- SwiftUI - For the user interface
- WatchKit - For Apple Watch specific functionality
- Foundation - For basic data structures and utilities

### Voice and NLP
- Speech - For speech recognition

- CoreMotion - For motion data processing

### Smart Home
- HomeKit - For smart home device control

### AI and Machine Learning
- CoreML - For on-device machine learning
- CreateML - For training custom models

### Connectivity
- WatchConnectivity - For iPhone-Watch communication
- Network - For networking functionality
- CloudKit - For cloud data syncing (optional)

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture with MVVM design pattern:

```

## Configuration and Setup

### Required Entitlements

The following entitlements are needed for the app:

- HealthKit
- Speech Recognition
- Siri
- HomeKit
- Background Processing (for health monitoring)

### Info.plist Keys

Add these keys to the Info.plist file:

- `NSHealthShareUsageDescription` - For accessing HealthKit data
- `NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription` - For writing to HealthKit
- `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` - For speech recognition
- `NSHomeKitUsageDescription` - For HomeKit access
- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` - For microphone access

### Setting Up Required Accounts and Services

1. **Apple Developer Account**
   - Enrollment in the Apple Developer Program
   - Proper App ID setup with required capabilities

2. **AI Service Integration** (optional)
   - For more advanced AI capabilities, integration with external AI providers may be configured

## Building and Running

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Select your team in the Signing & Capabilities section
4. Configure the entitlements and capabilities
5. Build and run on a paired Apple Watch

## Deployment Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Limit active animations to preserve battery life
- Implement efficient background processing
- Use CoreML for on-device processing when possible

### Battery Usage

- Minimize continuous health monitoring frequency
- Implement smart polling based on user activity
- Use efficient wake-up and background modes

### Privacy Considerations

- Implement data minimization practices
- Provide clear user controls for data sharing
- Use on-device processing when possible

## Multi-language Support

The app supports multiple languages through localization files. To add a new language:

1. Create a new `.strings` file in the Localizations directory
2. Configure the localization settings in Xcode
3. Update the language selection in the AssistantManager

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for core functionality
- UI tests for the main user flows
- HealthKit testing with simulated data
- Voice recognition testing with recorded samples
